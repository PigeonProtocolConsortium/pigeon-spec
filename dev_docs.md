# Messages: The Basic Building Block

The most important protocol concept is that of the "message".
In their most simple form, Pigeon protocol messages are just ASCII text documents. They are human readable and can even be created by hand in a text editor, though most clients will provide better means of authoring messages.

Below is an example of such a message:

```

```

The specifics of the message format are explained line-by-line [in the message format explanation document](message_format.md).
